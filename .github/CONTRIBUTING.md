# Contributing

As long as your pull request doesn't break the app in any way or conflict with an ongoing change (check the open issues first or send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) to make sure this doesn't happen), it will likely be accepted. I have a lot of projects and may not get around to reviewing pull requests right away. If you have contributed to this project before and would like to be added to this repository as a collaborator, feel free to send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) and ask.

## Branches

Because this is a terrible project with no organization, I am using the `master` branch for everything.
